Description = The fast fourier transformation (FFT) algorithm, is used to obtain a frequency-filtered version of an image. The Butterworth filter is a type of signal processing filter designed to have as flat a frequency response as possible in the passband. It is also referred to as a maximally flat magnitude filter.
